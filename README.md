# ggboral - Plot boral model results with ggplot

This package contains ggplot alternatives to the base R plotting functions in the boral package.
At the moment it is mainly intended for my own use and is very basic, but feedback and pull
requests are welcome. If it develops sufficiently I'll contribute it to CRAN but there are no
plans for that at the moment.

Share and enjoy!
