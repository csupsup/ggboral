# NEWS ggboral

Version 0.1.5 2018-12-18

Updated to work with boral package version 1.7, in which the number of latent
variables is set via the new lv.control list argument to the boral function.
The ggboral package now requires boral >= 1.7 but plotting functions will
still work with saved model objects from earlier versions.
